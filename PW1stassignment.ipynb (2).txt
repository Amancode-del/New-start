        "\n",
        "Q1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reasons for Python’s popularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Easy to Learn: Its clean and readable syntax makes it ideal for beginners.\n",
        "Versatile: Applicable in many domains such as web development, data science, AI, scripting, and automation.\n",
        "Large Community: A vast number of libraries, frameworks, tutorials, and community support are available.\n",
        "Cross-Platform: Python code can run on different operating systems without modification.\n",
        "High Demand: Its widespread use in the tech industry leads to strong job opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "An interpreter in Python is a program that executes code line by line, translating high-level Python instructions into machine-level code at runtime. Unlike compiled languages, Python does not require a separate compilation step—the interpreter processes the code directly and immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Interactive Development: You can test code snippets in real-time using tools like the Python shell or Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "Faster Debugging: Errors can be detected and fixed quickly, as the code runs line by line.\n",
        "Platform Independence: The interpreter abstracts away platform-specific details, making Python programs portable across systems.\n",
        "python’s interpreted nature is one of the key reasons it is so popular for rapid development, scripting, and learning programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that are an integral part of the language's syntax and structure. These keywords convey specific meanings and instructions to the Python interpreter and cannot be used as identifiers, such as variable names, function names, or class names.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are used to define the logic, control flow, and structure of Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Python keywords include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Control flow: if, elif, else, while, for, break, continue, pass\n",
        "Function and class definitions: def, return, lambda, class\n",
        "Exception handling: try, except, finally, raise\n",
        "Module management: import, from, as\n",
        "Boolean and null values: True, False, None\n",
        "Other structural elements: with, yield, global, nonlocal, assert, del, is, in, not, and, or\n",
        "To view the full list of keywords in your Python environment, you can use the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "help('keywords')\n",
        "Note: As of Python 3.x, there are over 30 keywords. Python keywords are case-sensitive and always written in lowercase (except True, False, and None).\n",
        "\n",
        "# use below also to see all keyword in one screen\n",
        "help('keywords')\n",
        "Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.\n",
        "\n",
        "False               class               from                or\n",
        "None                continue            global              pass\n",
        "True                def                 if                  raise\n",
        "and                 del                 import              return\n",
        "as                  elif                in                  try\n",
        "assert              else                is                  while\n",

        "await               finally             nonlocal            yield\n",
        "break               for                 not\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. Using them as variable names will result in a SyntaxError.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔒 Why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "Each keyword has a specific role (e.g., if for conditions, def for functions). Allowing them as variable names would create ambiguity in the code and confuse the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ Invalid Examples (will cause errors):\n",
        "\n",
        "if = 10 #SyntaxError\n",

        "Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutability refers to whether an object’s content can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "Mutable objects can be modified in place. Examples: lists, dictionaries, sets. are mutable\n",
        "Immutable objects cannot be changed once created—any modification creates a new object.\n",
        "🔁 Mutable Objects : These objects can be changed without changing their identity (memory address).\n",
        "\n",
        "🔁 Why it matters: : Understanding mutability is crucial for writing efficient code, especially when dealing with function arguments, memory usage, and debugging side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Examples for mutable\n",
        "# Mutable example (list)\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list[0] = 10  # Modifying the list\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Immutable example (string)\n",
        "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "# This will create a new string instead of modifying the original one\n",
        "my_string = \"world\"  # Reassigning to a new string\n",
        "print(my_string)  # Output: world\n",
        "[10, 2, 3]\n",
        "world\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable, due to the design choices in Python to provide different behaviors for these data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔁 Lists – Mutable Data Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be altered after creation. This includes operations such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modifying elements\n",
        "Adding or removing items\n",
        "Reordering elements\n",
        "This flexibility makes lists suitable for dynamic datasets where modification is expected during the program’s execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "#example of Mutable using list\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list[0] = 10       # Modifies the first element\n",
        "my_list.append(4)     # Adds a new element\n",
        "🔒 Tuples – Immutable Data Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. Any attempt to modify an element will result in a TypeError.\n",
        "\n",
        "This immutability provides several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Integrity: Prevents accidental changes, which is critical in situations requiring constant data.\n",
        "Hashability: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets—something mutable objects like lists cannot do.\n",
        "Performance: Tuples are generally more memory-efficient and slightly faster due to their fixed size and structure.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "my_tuple[0] = 10  # ❌ TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",

        "Feature List (Mutable)  Tuple (Immutable)\n",
        "Modifiable  Yes No\n",
        "Syntax  [1, 2, 3]   (1, 2, 3)\n",

        "Memory Efficiency   Less efficient  More efficient\n",
        "Hashable (usable as dict key)   No  Yes (if fully immutable)\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "The mutability of lists allows for flexible, dynamic data management, whereas the immutability of tuples ensures data stability, hashability, and optimization in contexts where change is neither expected nor desired.\n",

        "Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, == and is are comparison operators, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 == (Equality Operator)\n",
        "\n",
        "Compares the values of two objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns True if the contents are equal, even if the objects are stored at different memory locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "print(a == b) # ✅ True — values are the same\n",
        "🔹 is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "\n",
        "Compares the identity of two objects (i.e., whether they refer to the same memory location).\n",
        "Returns True only if both variables point to the exact same object.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "c = a\n",
        "print(a is b) # ❌ False — different objects in memory\n",
        "print(a is c) # ✅ True — same object\n",
        "Note: For immutable types like small integers and strings, Python may optimize memory usage by reusing objects, which can make is appear True in some cases—but this behavior should not be relied upon for equality checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "est Practice:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use == for comparing values and is for checking object identity or comparing to None (e.g., if x is None:).\n",

        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return a Boolean result (True or False). They operate on Boolean values and are primarily used in control flow (e.g., if, while) and expressions involving conditions.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "and (Logical AND)\n",

        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution based on specified conditions. They allow programs to make decisions, execute certain blocks of code only when a condition is met, and handle different scenarios dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "🎯 Primary Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "To enable decision-making in a program by executing different code paths depending on whether a given condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "if statement – Executes a block if the condition is True.\n",
        "if-else statement – Executes one block if the condition is True, another if it is False.\n",

        "\n",
        "The elif (short for “else if”) statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions sequentially. It allows a program to test several expressions for truth value and execute a specific block of code for the first true condition encountered.\n",

        "How it works:\n",
