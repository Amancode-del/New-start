        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, data structures are built-in types and user-defined structures used to organize and store data efficiently. Python provides a rich set of built-in data structures, and also allows you to create your own using classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "List:- A list in Python is an ordered, mutable collection of elements that can hold items of any data type. Lists allow duplicate values and support operations such as adding, removing, and updating elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax: Defined using square brackets []\n",
        "Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple']\n",
        "Tuple : A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. Like lists, tuples can contain elements of different data types and allow duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax: Defined using parentheses ()\n",
        "Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'apple')\n",

        "Definition\tA list is a mutable sequence\tA tuple is an immutable sequence\n",
        "Syntax\tCreated using square brackets []\tCreated using parentheses ()\n",
        "Mutability\t✅ Mutable (can be changed)\t❌ Immutable (cannot be changed)\n",
        "Methods Available\tMany built-in methods like append(), remove(), sort()\tFewer methods (mostly read-only)\n",
        "Performance\tSlower than tuples (more memory usage due to flexibility)\tFaster and more memory-efficient\n",
        "Use Case\tUsed for collections that may change (e.g. dynamic data)\tUsed for fixed data (e.g. coordinates, constants)\n",
        "Can be a dictionary key?\t❌ No (not hashable)\t✅ Yes (if elements are also immutable)\n",

        "Q 4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. A dictionary in Python is an unordered, mutable collection that stores data in key-value pairs. It uses a highly optimized data structure called a hash table to store and retrieve values efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basic Structure : A dictionary is written using curly braces {} with keys and values separated by a colon :\n",
        "Example: person = { \"name\": \"Umer Nazir\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"Srinagar\"}\n",
        "Each item consists of a key and a value.\n",
        "Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples).\n",
        "Values can be of any data type.\n",
        "Internal Working (How Data is Stored)\n",
        "\n",
        "Python dictionaries use a hash table for storage. Here's how it works:\n",
        "Hashing the Key:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python applies a hash function to each key using the built-in hash() function.\n",
        "The result is a hash value — an integer that determines where the key-value pair is placed in memory.\n",
        "Indexing:\n",
        "\n",
        "The hash value is mapped to an index in an internal array (the hash table).\n",
        "This index tells Python where to store or find the value.\n",
        "Handling Collisions:\n",
        "\n",
        "If two keys produce the same hash index, Python uses techniques like open addressing to resolve the conflict and find another available slot.\n",
        "Retrieval:\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a value, Python hashes the key, finds the corresponding index, and returns the associated value.\n",
        "Average time complexity for lookup, insert, and delete: O(1).\n",
        "🧪 Example below Python hashes 'score', locates it in memory, and retrieves 85.\n",
        "\n",
        "student = {'name': 'Umer Nazir', 'score': 85}\n",
        "print(student['score'])  # Output: 85\n",

        "Q 5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, you might choose to use a set instead of a list for several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Uniqueness of Elements:\n",
        "Sets automatically eliminate duplicates.\n",
        "If you want to store only unique items, a set is ideal.\n",

        "my_set = set(my_list)\n",
        "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "{1, 2, 3}\n",
        "Faster Membership Testing:\n",
        "Sets use hash tables internally, making in checks much faster than lists.\n",

        "True\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes \" \". It is used to store and manipulate textual data. while as list is a sequence that can hold multiple data types, including numbers, strings, or even other lists, a list is enclosed in squae brackets []\n",

        "Q7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Tuples help ensure data integrity because they are immutable — meaning once created, they cannot be changed. This immutability provides several key benefits:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides fast access to values based on their keys. It uses a hash function to convert each key into a unique number (called a hash), which determines where the value is stored in memory.\n",
